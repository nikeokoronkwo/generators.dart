# Generators
A set of generators based on the [`code_builder`](https://pub.dev/packages/code_builder) package by Dart, used for generating code for multiple programming languages using the builder API.

> This is experimental 

## Supported Languages
As of now, the languages supported are high-level languages that interop with Dart:
- Swift
- Kotlin
- JavaScript/TypeScript

## Upcoming Languages
The following languages are planned for, and will be coming up
- [ ] Java

## Using this package
Using this package

## TypeScript/JavaScript
One of the generators include a JS/TS generator, which can be used to either generate JavaScript, TypeScript, or TS Type Definitions code. When making use of an emitter, you can set the generation mode to the given language you want, or use the necessary constructor.
